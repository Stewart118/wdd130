            <p>Hello! My name is John Stewart and I live in Georgia!  I am a software engineer coming back to school to acquire Web Development skills.  I love playing board games, traveling, going to movies, and spending time with my wife and dog.</p>
            <p>The photo was taken at the NASCAR Hall of Fame in Charlotte, North Carolina.  It was quite a fun place to visit!  Not only do they have race cars and memorabilia, but they also have a racing simulator that is definitely worth a visit.</p>

            <p>The Wormsloe State Historic Site, shown in the photo, was established by one of Georgia's colonial founders, Noble Jones.  Georgia is one of the original 13 colonies and the 8th most populated state in the United States.  It is known as the Peach State, but also produces a variety of other items such as peacans and peanuts. It has a milder climate than Florida, but still manages to avoid snow storms.  It is a wonderful place to live and visit!</p>
