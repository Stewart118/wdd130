            <p>The Wormsloe State Historic Site, shown in the photo, was established by one of Georgia's colonial founders, Noble Jones.  Georgia is one of the original 13 colonies and the 8th most populated state in the United States.  It is known as the Peach State, but also produces a variety of other items such as peacans and peanuts. It has a milder climate than Florida, but still manages to avoid snow storms.  It is a wonderful place to live and visit!</p>
